The Fair Project:
 - For the Java Bootcamp I got the assignment to assimilate (only with Java) selling tickets to hop on different rides of a fair
 - Per ride has different ticket price
 - Make it remember how many tickets was sold per attraction type
 - Per attraction type, calculate the income
 - Make sure that after certain "risky" rides, that I call maintenance handyman after certain amount of time that ride has spinned
